## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Launch the game from your terminal.  
2. Start guessing the secret word, letter by letter.  
3. Each incorrect guess adds to the hangman figure and costs you a life.  
4. If you guess the entire word, you win! 🎉  
5. If you're one wrong move from losing, you'll receive a **life-saving hint**.  
6. Game ends when:  
   - ✅ You guess the word, or  
   - ❌ You run out of lives.
